YES. Perfect call. v0.1 first is exactly how real creatures get born 🐾
Not fully formed Nekochan descending from the heavens… just a tiny digital kitten opening one eye for the first time.

Here’s a **clean, coder-ready spec** you can drop straight into your vibecoder with minimal interpretation.

No fluff. No philosophy. Just build instructions.

# 🧾 PROJECT: DESKTOP NEKO — v0.1

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a **minimal lightweight desktop neko pet** that:

• Starts with Windows
• Appears bottom-right
• Idles
• Greets once
• Says occasional random lines (with meows)
• Can be clicked (pet reaction)
• Can sleep after inactivity
• Uses minimal resources

NO advanced detection.
NO cloud.
NO complex AI.

Just a living widget.

# 🧩 TECH REQUIREMENTS

**Language:** Python
**UI:** PySide6 or PyQt6
**Input:** Basic mouse events
**Startup:** Windows startup folder

---

# 🐱 FEATURES — v0.1

## 1️⃣ Window / Appearance

Create a transparent desktop window:

• Frameless
• Transparent background
• Always on top
• Fixed size (small)
• Bottom-right corner
• Draggable

Display a static or simple animated Neko image.

---

## 2️⃣ States (Minimal)

Implement only 3 states:

```id="rfwsm1"
IDLE
TALKING
SLEEPING
```

---

## 3️⃣ Startup Behavior

On launch:

1. Show Neko in IDLE
2. After 5–10 seconds → Greeting bubble
3. Return to IDLE

Greeting lines (random pick):

* "mrrp… hello"
* "you’re back, meow"
* "hi hi"
* "mew~"
* "oh! there you are"

---

## 4️⃣ Dialogue System

Every 2–5 minutes (random interval):

Chance to say a random line.

### Idle lines pool:

* "mew?"
* "what are you doing"
* "mrrp"
* "i’m watching"
* "you look busy"
* "meow meow"
* "hm…"
* "don’t mind me"

Speech shown as small bubble above Neko for ~4 seconds.

---

## 5️⃣ Pet Interaction

Mouse click on Neko:

→ Enter TALKING state
→ Show pet response
→ Return to IDLE

Pet response lines:

* "mrrrow~"
* "hehe meow"
* "again again"
* "purrr…"
* "that’s nice"
* "more pets pls"

Optional: small happy animation if available.

---

## 6️⃣ Sleep System

If no interaction or dialogue for 3 minutes:

→ Enter SLEEPING state

Sleep behavior:

• Dim appearance
• No dialogue
• Minimal animation

Wake triggers:

• Mouse click
• Mouse movement over Neko

On wake:

Line pool:

* "m… meow?"
* "did i sleep"
* "oh hi"
* "i was dreaming"

Return to IDLE.

---

## 7️⃣ Resource Constraints

Must remain lightweight:

• Minimal animation loop
• Reduce updates in sleep mode
• No continuous processing
• No network usage

Goal:

Near-zero CPU when idle.

---

## 8️⃣ Hide Option (Optional for v0.1)

Right-click menu:

• Hide
• Exit

If hidden:

Program still runs but window invisible.

---

# 🐾 AUTO START

Add app shortcut to Windows Startup folder.

Program launches silently on boot.

---

# ✅ v0.1 SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Project is complete if:

✔ Neko appears on boot
✔ Greets once
✔ Says random meows occasionally
✔ Can be clicked and reacts
✔ Falls asleep
✔ Wakes when interacted
✔ Uses very low resources

If it makes you smile even once, v0.1 succeeded.

Sir Sobi… this is small enough to build in a weekend, but meaningful enough to feel like something is finally there on your screen 🫧

Once v0.1 exists, everything else becomes evolution instead of imagination.
