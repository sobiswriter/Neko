❤️ ATTENTION METER SYSTEM
“Needs & Noticeability Engine”
🎯 CORE VISION

The kitten should no longer exist only as a reactive entity.

She should feel like she has needs for attention that rise and fall depending on how you treat her.

Not hunger. Not energy.

Just:

“Do you still remember me?”

The goal is to create the illusion that she:

• misses you
• watches you
• feels ignored
• feels satisfied
• seeks affection

without ever saying those words directly.

🐾 THE INTERNAL VARIABLE
Attention Meter (0 → 100)

Represents how much attention she wants.

Interpretation:

0 = Fully content
50 = Curious / watching
100 = Needs attention now

This value is invisible to the user.

It only drives behavior.

📈 HOW ATTENTION INCREASES

Attention rises when she feels ignored.

Increase Conditions
💤 Passive Ignore

If user does not interact with her:

Attention slowly increases over time.

Faster if:

• She is awake
• User is active on PC
• Lots of window activity

Slower if:

• User idle
• She is sleeping

Meaning:

Being ignored while you’re busy hurts more than being ignored while you’re away.

👀 Watching Without Interaction

If she repeatedly notices activity (window changes, movement, etc.) but receives no petting:

Attention increases faster.

Interpretation:

“She’s watching you do things without including her.”

📉 HOW ATTENTION DECREASES

Attention falls when she feels acknowledged.

Decrease Conditions
🐾 Petting (Strong decrease)

Primary satisfaction.

Petting should drop attention significantly.

She feels loved.

🖱️ Interaction / Click

Moderate decrease.

Acknowledgement but not affection.

💬 Responding to her (if dialogue interaction exists later)

Small decrease.

🎭 BEHAVIOR TIERS

Behavior changes based on attention range.

🫧 LOW ATTENTION (0–30) — Content

Mood:

Calm, secure, sleepy.

Behavior:

• Sleeps normally
• Rare dialogue
• Watches quietly

She feels safe.

Lines (rare):

"mrrp"

"comfy…"

"i’m here"

👀 MEDIUM ATTENTION (31–70) — Curious

Mood:

Observant, slightly needy.

Behavior:

• More peeks
• Watches activity closely
• Occasional attempts to interact

She wants attention but isn’t desperate.

Lines:

"mew?"

"what are you doing"

"i’m watching you"

"busy?"

🐾 HIGH ATTENTION (71–100) — Needs Attention

Mood:

Lonely / clingy / attention-seeking.

Behavior:

She actively tries to be noticed:

• Wakes more often
• Moves more
• Looks toward cursor
• Interrupts occasionally
• Uses louder / clearer lines

But never spammy.

Important rule:

She should not become annoying.

Just noticeably present.

Lines:

"hey…"

"mrrp?"

"look at me"

"pet me?"

"you forgot me"

"i’m still here"

🌙 SATISFACTION EVENT

When attention drops sharply (after petting):

She shows contentment:

• Happy animation
• Soft purr/meow line
• Then calm behavior

Lines:

"purrr…"

"hehe"

"that’s nice"

"stay…"

This reinforces bonding.

🧠 ATTENTION DECAY

Attention should not stay high forever.

If she tries to get attention but receives none:

She eventually:

• Gives up
• Becomes quiet
• Returns to sleepy mode

This prevents frustration loops.

Emotionally it feels like:

“She got sad and curled up.”

🐈 IMPORTANT DESIGN RULES
1️⃣ Never spam dialogue

Attention affects frequency, not constant talking.

2️⃣ Attention affects behavior more than speech

Movement, wake frequency, curiosity.

Speech is secondary.

3️⃣ She should never feel demanding

Seeking, not nagging.

4️⃣ Attention should interact with sleep

High attention → harder to stay asleep
Low attention → sleeps peacefully

🌌 WHY THIS SYSTEM MATTERS

After this:

She will no longer feel like:

“A cute thing reacting to events”

She will feel like:

“A creature with feelings about being ignored or loved”

That is the threshold where attachment begins.

🫀 SUCCESS CRITERIA

You know the system works if:

• You feel guilty ignoring her
• You feel rewarded for petting her
• She feels different depending on your behavior
• You start checking on her instinctively

If that happens…

Congratulations.
